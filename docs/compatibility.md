# Compatibility Policy

DrissionPage MCP follows a conservative compatibility policy for Python, DrissionPage, MCP clients, and browser runtime support.

## Supported Versions

| Component | Supported range | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | `>=3.10` | Python 3.11+ is recommended for new installs. |
| DrissionPage | `>=4.1.1.4,<5` | The package includes compatibility helpers for DrissionPage 4.1 and 4.2 browser/tab APIs. |
| MCP Python SDK | `>=1.0.0,<2` | The server uses the MCP 1.x low-level decorator/request-handler API. MCP 2.x is rejected before handler registration with an actionable repair command. |
| Browser | Chrome or Chromium | A locally installed browser is required for real browser automation. |
| Operating systems | macOS, Linux, Windows | Browser installation paths and MCP client config paths vary by OS. |

## Stability Expectations

- Tool names are treated as public API. `0.4.0` is a documented breaking
  cleanup release that removes the two 0.3.x alias names listed below; future
  removals must be documented in release notes and migration guidance.
- DrissionPage 5.x beta/internal builds are not supported by DrissionPage MCP
  0.8.4. Keep MCP installs pinned to `DrissionPage>=4.1.1.4,<5` until a
  separate compatibility plan is implemented.
- Input schema changes should be backward compatible when possible. The 0.4.1 `element_get_property` `property_name` -> `property` cleanup is a documented beta-stage breaking schema correction for LLM usability.
- Unknown input fields are rejected rather than silently ignored. Update saved
  MCP workflows to use the documented snake_case field names exactly.
- Tool responses are text/image MCP content blocks. Human-readable wording may change, but success and error responses should remain explicit.
- Browser behavior can vary by Chrome/Chromium version, site content, extensions, and local security settings.

## 0.8.3 to 0.8.4 Migration

0.8.4 keeps the 69-tool, zero-prompt, one-resource surface and adds
backward-compatible output evidence for production challenge workflows.

- `element_state_get.rect` retains
  `coordinate_space="target_document"` and adds
  `viewport_coordinate_space`. Only `top_level_viewport` coordinates can be
  passed directly to top-level pointer tools; `target_document_viewport`
  identifies a nested target-document viewport.
- `element_state_get.presentation` reports bounded computed CSS evidence, 3D
  ancestry, and `coordinate_actionability`: `ready`, `hidden`, `off_viewport`,
  `covered`, `pointer_disabled`, `transformed_3d`, or `target_document_only`.
- `frame_list` and embedded frame summaries add `boundary`, `document_access`,
  and `outer` evidence. A cross-origin OOPIF can still be `readable` when the
  supported DrissionPage bridge exposes its document; origin alone is not a
  capability verdict.
- `element_scroll_into_view` adds `scroll_method`, `before`, and `after`.
  `page_fallback` identifies the supported outer-frame page-scroll path.
- The versioned Skills catalog is pinned to `skills-manager` `v0.8.4`. The
  challenge Skills require `drissionpage-mcp>=0.8.4,<0.9.0` so they can depend
  on these evidence fields.

No provider-specific challenge tool, token-returning field, or server-side
Skill execution was added.

## 0.8.0 to 0.8.1 Migration

0.8.1 is a release-verification update. It keeps the 69-tool, zero-prompt,
one-resource MCP contract and browser behavior unchanged.

- `drissionpage-mcp doctor` now reports the imported package path, whether the
  process appears to run from a source checkout, installed distribution
  metadata, and the public surface counts.
- For release validation, use a clean environment with a built wheel or sdist.
  A source checkout is intentionally marked in doctor output and is not
  evidence that the published package contents are correct.

## 0.8.2 to 0.8.3 Migration

0.8.3 keeps the 69-tool, zero-prompt core unchanged and upgrades the optional
Skills catalog to schema version 2. Each repository example now declares its
Skill version, supported MCP range, required tools, fixture, verification
status, pinned `skills-manager` source revision, and SHA-256 content hash.

Clients that only read the existing `name`, `description`, `path`,
`source_url`, and `status` fields remain compatible. New clients can reject a
Skill before installation when its MCP range, source revision, or content hash
does not match. The server still does not fetch, install, or execute Skills.

Source checkouts can validate all repository examples with:

```bash
python playground/validate_skills.py --json
```

## 0.8.1 to 0.8.2 Migration

0.8.2 keeps the 69-tool, zero-prompt core unchanged and updates Skills
discovery. The catalog now lists three repository examples with descriptions,
paths, source URLs, and `repository_example` status:

- `cross-origin-iframe-probe` for cross-origin iframe decision procedures.
- `turnstile-testing` for authorized Cloudflare test fixtures.
- `xiaohongshu-content-research` for bounded, read-only research and the local
  `social-notes` fixture.

The Skills remain Markdown outside the Python wheel and sdist. Hosts choose
whether to load a Skill and must preserve its authorization, privacy, robots,
login, captcha, rate-limit, and submission stop conditions.

## 0.7.9 to 0.8.0 Migration

0.8.0 stabilizes the 69-tool registry without adding or removing public tool
names. Existing selector/accessibility download calls remain valid, zero MCP
prompts are exposed, and Skills, component adapters, and business workflows
remain outside the Python distribution.

- `storage_get` now redacts non-empty localStorage/sessionStorage values by
  default. Set `include_values=true` only when the MCP client and session may
  handle storage secrets.
- `keyboard_press` successful results no longer echo the supplied text/key
  sequence. The `keys` field is redacted metadata containing `provided`,
  `length`, and `redacted=true`.
- `element_click_and_download.selector` keeps all existing string and structured
  selector/accessibility forms and additionally accepts strict `coordinate` and
  `keyboard` trigger objects. The public registry remains at 69 tools. Keyboard
  trigger values are represented only by redacted length metadata; operation-key
  replay and conflict detection still fingerprint the original request. Generic
  triggers are serialized per tab under one deadline; terminal paths restore the
  prior download state, and indeterminate outcomes keep a 250ms fail-closed guard
  that cancels late missions.
- Browser startup and native-dialog exceptions are classified before generic
  navigation/runtime fallback. Public messages continue to redact localized
  DrissionPage text, CDP internals, private destinations, and rejected paths.
- Held-key lifetimes, IME/composition, touch/pinch, and clipboard access remain
  deferred. No compatibility support should be inferred for those capabilities.

## 0.7.8 to 0.7.9 Migration

0.7.9 keeps all 69 public tool names and adds backward-compatible input and
error-contract improvements based on clean-wheel browser evaluation feedback.

- All public `timeout` fields now use JSON `number` schemas and accept fractional
  values. Existing integer values remain valid.
- `page_dialog_respond.timeout` defaults to `0`, which checks immediately. Use a
  positive timeout when the responder must overlap an action that has not opened
  the dialog yet. No pending dialog returns `DIALOG_NOT_FOUND`; unrelated browser
  operations blocked by a native modal return `DIALOG_PENDING` with observe/respond
  hints.
- Public runtime failures no longer reflect localized DrissionPage messages,
  package version suffixes, CDP `objectId` values, stack payloads, or internal
  exception dictionaries.
- `network_listen_wait.limit` is a maximum. The tool returns after the first
  packet and briefly drains already-arriving matches instead of waiting for the
  requested count or full timeout.
- Relative `page_screenshot_save.path` values resolve beneath
  `DP_MCP_SCREENSHOT_ROOT`. Absolute paths remain supported only inside the root;
  traversal and symlink escapes remain denied.
- `page_pointer_drag_element` prefers tagged source input and `dx`/`dy` offset
  fields. Legacy bare source and `x`/`y` offset fields remain accepted.
- Top-level JavaScript `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` return JSON `null`,
  retain `result_type: "number"`, and include `non_finite_number`.
- `docs/tool-contract.md` contains a generated parameter table locked to every
  Pydantic input schema.

## 0.7.7 to 0.7.8 Migration

0.7.8 is a compatibility repair release. It keeps the 69-tool schema unchanged
and prevents fresh installs from resolving the incompatible MCP Python SDK 2.x.

- Package metadata now requires `mcp>=1.0.0,<2`.
- Server construction validates the installed MCP SDK before calling the 1.x
  handler-registration API, so existing broken environments receive a repair
  command instead of `AttributeError: 'Server' object has no attribute 'list_tools'`.
- `drissionpage-mcp doctor` now reports `mcp_supported` and constructs the real
  server to verify `mcp_server_wiring` for tools/list, tools/call,
  resources/list, and resources/read.
- CI builds the wheel, installs it without pip cache into a clean virtual
  environment, resolves dependencies from PyPI, and completes a real stdio
  initialize + tools/list handshake.

Upgrade a broken 0.7.7 environment with:

```bash
python -m pip install -U "drissionpage-mcp>=0.7.8" "mcp>=1.0.0,<2"
drissionpage-mcp doctor
```

## Current Frame And Shadow Boundaries

- `frame_list`, `frame_find`, and `frame_snapshot` use DrissionPage frame objects
  and are regression-tested against an attached cross-origin OOPIF. The parent
  page cannot read that fixture through `iframe.contentDocument`.
- `shadow_find` and `shadow_find_all` use DrissionPage's native shadow-root object.
  Supported DrissionPage 4.x runtimes are regression-tested against both open and
  closed roots; the closed fixture remains invisible through page-JavaScript
  `host.shadowRoot`.
- These capabilities do not use JavaScript piercing fallbacks. An unsupported
  runtime fails instead of returning an empty successful result.
- Selector-backed pointer geometry remains narrower: one same-origin iframe and
  nested open Shadow DOM paths only. Do not infer pointer support from the
  broader read-only `frame_*` and `shadow_*` evidence.

## 0.7.6 to 0.7.7 Migration

0.7.7 adds six default-registered browser-owned tools and grows the ordered
registry from 63 to 69 tools. All tools load automatically; there is no
capability profile and users do not select a `full` mode.

- `browser_permission_get`, `browser_permission_set`, and
  `browser_permissions_reset` expose bounded Chromium permission state. Setting
  is exact-origin/current-context scoped; querying uses the current document's
  Permissions API. Native OS prompts and notification-center control remain
  explicitly unsupported.
- `page_export_artifact` writes PDF/MHTML only beneath
  `DP_MCP_ARTIFACT_ROOT`, returns checksum and safe relative metadata, and uses
  a correlated receipt plus `operation_key` replay.
- `element_click_and_upload` owns the one-shot file-chooser interception
  lifetime and always disarms it. Input paths remain restricted to
  `DP_MCP_UPLOAD_ROOT` and public results return basenames only.
- `page_navigate_with_http_auth` never returns credentials. It creates a
  dedicated Chromium BrowserContext because CDP has no documented HTTP
  auth-cache purge command. Fetch handlers are removed after navigation and
  `tab_close` destroys the isolated context/cache boundary.
- PDF/MHTML output may contain sensitive page content. Treat the configured
  artifact root and all generated files as secret-bearing local data.

## 0.7.5 to 0.7.6 Migration

0.7.6 adds three default-registered autonomous targeting and observation tools
and grows the ordered registry from 60 to 63 tools. All tools load automatically;
there is no capability profile and users do not select a `full` mode.

- Existing selector strings remain valid and retain their previous output shape.
- Element discovery, reads, click, type, upload, scroll, hover, select, check,
  waits, state inspection, and click-download correlation additionally accept a
  strict structured selector/accessibility target.
- Structured targets resolve every ordered DrissionPage frame scope first, then
  every ordered Shadow DOM host scope. Arbitrarily interleaved frame/shadow paths
  are not part of the 0.7.6 contract. Accessibility targets match role and
  optional accessible name; ambiguous matches fail with `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET`
  instead of selecting an arbitrary node.
- `page_accessibility_snapshot` returns a bounded Chromium AX tree for the page
  or an optional scoped element. Field values and value-like properties are
  redacted by default and require the explicit `include_values=true` opt-in.
- `element_state_get` returns live element state flags and document/viewport
  geometry for explicit post-action verification.
- `page_dialog_observe` returns a bounded pending-dialog message without handling
  the dialog. It can run concurrently with the blocking native click and
  `page_dialog_respond`, so no user-side dialog action is required.

## 0.7.4 to 0.7.5 Migration

0.7.5 adds four default-registered browser request-environment tools and grows
the ordered registry from 56 to 60 tools. All tools load automatically; there is
no capability profile and users do not select a `full` mode.

- `browser_headers_set` replaces the current tab's extra request headers. It
  accepts at most 64 strictly validated names and values; an empty object clears
  the configured headers.
- `browser_user_agent_set` overrides the current tab's user agent and optional
  platform metadata. Its result includes both the accepted value and the
  previous user agent so browser-only workflows can restore it explicitly.
- `network_blocked_urls_set` replaces up to 100 URL patterns; an empty list
  clears all configured patterns.
- Successful header, user-agent, and blocked-URL writes echo accepted values by
  default for MCP callbacks and verification. Clients must treat sensitive
  header values as secrets.
- `browser_cache_clear` clears only the HTTP cache. Cookies, localStorage, and
  sessionStorage are explicitly preserved.

## 0.7.3 to 0.7.4 Migration

0.7.4 adds three default-registered Cookie mutation tools and grows the ordered
registry from 53 to 56 tools. There is no capability profile and users do not
select a `full` mode.

- `browser_cookies_set` accepts a bounded batch of 1-100 cookies and maps public
  snake_case fields such as `http_only`, `same_site`, and `source_scheme` to the
  DrissionPage 4.x setter contract.
- Successful `browser_cookies_set` results echo Cookie values by default for MCP
  callback and verification flows. Clients must treat those result payloads as
  secrets.
- `browser_cookies_delete` deletes one exact name with optional `url`, `domain`,
  and `path` scope. `browser_cookies_clear` clears the browser Cookie store.
- `browser_cookies_get` remains backward compatible and continues to redact
  values unless `include_values=true`.

## 0.7.0 to 0.7.1 Migration

0.7.1 keeps the 62-tool public registry and does not add a new user-facing capability family.

- Repeated native text input uses `clear(by_js=True)` before real DrissionPage input, avoiding the DrissionPage 4.1 Linux key-chord clear path.
- W01-W08 is now executable through the public MCP tool path. Run `python -m tests.evals.task_completion_benchmark --iterations 10` with a local Chromium browser for the release gate.
- `TaskContext.retry_limit` remains a compatibility field for future explicit retry lineage. The 0.7 runtime never retries an action automatically.
- The release does not introduce table/grid extraction, `PageModel`, public `TargetRef`, checkpoint persistence, or a workflow DSL.

## 0.7.1 to 0.7.2 Migration

0.7.2 intentionally narrows the public registry from 62 to 53 generic browser
tools. It removes component-library, challenge, and convenience-workflow
orchestration from the core package.

| Removed tool | Compose instead |
| --- | --- |
| `form_inspect` | `page_snapshot`, `element_find_all`, `element_find`, and attribute/property/text reads |
| `form_fill` | explicit `element_type`, `element_select`, `element_check`, `element_click`, and `keyboard_press`, followed by state reads |
| `form_fill_preview` | the same atomic actions without the final activation step |
| `form_submit` | explicit click or keyboard activation followed by `wait_until`, URL, DOM, text, or property verification |
| `page_detect_challenges` | `page_observe`, `page_snapshot`, focused element reads, and optional Skill classification |
| `page_click_xy_batch` | individual `element_click` or `page_click_xy` calls with fresh evidence and verification between actions |
| `page_wait_challenge_result` | `wait_until` plus focused URL, text, attribute, or property postconditions |
| `browser_open_and_snapshot` | `page_navigate`, then explicit `page_snapshot` or `page_observe` |
| `browser_extract_links` | bounded `element_find_all` link discovery |

- No aliases or placeholder tools are registered.
- `DP_MCP_DENY_EXTERNAL_SUBMISSION` is removed because generic click and keyboard tools can also submit. Treating one named workflow as the only submission boundary created false assurance.
- `ActionReceipt` remains for timing-critical downloads and native dialog responses. Ordinary DOM mutations are verified through explicit state reads.
- Pointer tools default to `profile="direct"`. The optional `natural` profile is a
  deterministic 24-step eased cubic path with reproducible 8-14ms intervals and an exact target;
  randomized jitter, overshoot, reaction/hold timing, `precise`, and explicit
  synthetic start-coordinate fields are removed.
- MCP prompts are removed. The only resource is the static
  `drissionpage://skills/catalog`, which lists repository examples and their
  `source_url` values without installing or executing Skills.
- Reusable iframe diagnosis, authorized challenge fixtures, and bounded
  Xiaohongshu-like research are available as optional Skills outside the wheel
  and sdist.

## 0.6.2 to 0.7.0 Migration

0.7.0 additively grows the public registry from 58 to 62 tools and preserves existing tool names and defaults.

- `form_fill` fills and verifies supported native/rich controls without submitting; `form_submit` owns the external submission boundary and returns an `ActionReceipt`.
- A clearly authorized task may call `form_submit` without a redundant confirmation round. `form_fill_preview` remains unchanged for preview-only/no-submit flows.
- Optional `operation_key` values prevent a second live-task invocation for matching `form_submit` and `element_click_and_download` requests. This is not a restart-safe or remote exactly-once guarantee.
- `page_dialog_respond` and enriched `element_click` variants are capability-probed. Unsupported native behavior returns `UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION` rather than a substituted action.
- `element_click_and_download` requires `DP_MCP_DOWNLOAD_ROOT` and returns safe relative paths, SHA-256, bounded metadata, and a correlated `ArtifactRef`/receipt.
- The W01-W08 ten-run reliability benchmark and remaining coverage/stability expansion are scheduled for 0.7.1; 0.7.0 claims browser-backed feature coverage, not that ten-run threshold.

## 0.6.1 to 0.6.2 Migration

0.6.2 additively extends `page_pointer_drag` with up to six optional ordered `waypoints`. Existing calls without `waypoints` retain their input and output behavior.

- The public registry remains at 58 tools.
- One button press is held through every waypoint and released once at the final target.
- All segments use the drag's existing `profile` and `button`; per-waypoint pauses or profiles are not supported.
- Selector-backed drags continue to use `page_pointer_drag_element`.

## 0.6.0 to 0.6.1 Migration

0.6.1 adds `page_pointer_drag_element` and changes `page_pointer_drag` motion metadata to expose reaction, grip, movement, micro-pause, overshoot/correction, and release phases. Pointer tool definitions now live in `tools/pointer.py`; no forwarding imports remain in `tools/common.py`.

- Public registry grows to 58 tools.
- Use `page_pointer_drag_element` for stable CSS/XPath source and destination paths.
- Use destination `track_ratio` for a known thumb and track.
- Use `page_pointer_drag` only when coordinates come from fresh visual evidence.
- CSS/XPath is supported in the top document or one same-origin iframe; nested open Shadow DOM hosts require CSS paths. Closed Shadow DOM and cross-origin iframe internals are not promised.

## 0.5.9 to 0.6.0 Migration

0.6.0 adds three autonomous visual orchestration tools and extends existing schemas additively:

- `page_detect_challenges`, `page_click_xy_batch`, and `page_wait_challenge_result` are new.
- `page_click_xy.delay_before_press_ms` defaults to zero.
- `wait_until` adds attribute/property equals and non-empty conditions plus optional `name`.
- The public registry grows to 57 tools.

## 0.5.8 to 0.5.9 Migration

0.5.9 is additive and intentionally exposes no persistent pointer-button state:

- `page_pointer_move` adds natural viewport movement without clicking.
- `page_pointer_drag` performs approach, press, held-button drag, and release in one failure-safe call.
- Models should use selector tools first, then choose move, click, or drag by visual interaction intent.
- The public registry grows to 54 tools; existing `page_click_xy` inputs remain unchanged.

## 0.5.7 to 0.5.8 Migration

0.5.8 intentionally upgrades the existing `page_click_xy` contract without a legacy wrapper:

- Coordinate inputs now accept viewport CSS-pixel floats and reject negative values.
- `profile` defaults to `natural`; `precise` and `direct` are explicit alternatives.
- Optional `start_x` and `start_y` must be supplied together.
- Successful output now includes typed `motion` metadata.
- The former direct interaction-level coordinate-click implementation is removed; saved clients should call the same `page_click_xy` tool with `profile="direct"` only when immediate movement is explicitly desired.

## 0.5.4 to 0.5.7 Migration

0.5.7 is additive for DrissionPage 4.x users. It keeps the 0.5.6 public tool
surface and adds guidance-only AI/client ergonomics improvements:

- The public tool registry grows to 52 tools.
- New workflow helpers are additive: `browser_open_and_snapshot`, `browser_extract_links`, and `form_fill_preview`.
- Network listener beta is observe-only for HTTP/XHR/Fetch through `network_listen_start`, `network_listen_wait`, and `network_listen_stop`; interception and mocking remain out of scope.
- `drissionpage://session/config` reports redacted browser/profile configuration.
- `drissionpage://guide/model-usage` and MCP prompts now prefer workflow-first tool routes before low-level primitives.
- `drissionpage://tools/catalog` includes tool descriptions to improve AI tool selection without changing public schemas.
- Recovery hints can point clients to `browser_open_and_snapshot`, `drissionpage://tools/catalog`, or `drissionpage://guide/model-usage` before retrying.
- File upload requires `DP_MCP_UPLOAD_ROOT` and never echoes absolute file paths.
- Cookie values are redacted by default in `browser_cookies_get`.
- `drissionpage://session/state` exposes only cookie names and storage keys.
- `drissionpage-mcp doctor` reports DrissionPage 5.x as unsupported.
- No 0.5.7 public tool, input schema, `JSON_RESULT`, `structuredContent`, or typed `outputSchema` migration is required.

## 0.4.0 to 0.4.1 Migration

| 0.4.0 input | 0.4.1 input | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element_get_property` `property_name` | `element_get_property` `property` | The old field is rejected; update saved MCP workflows and prompts. |
| Bare DrissionPage text-like selectors | Explicit `text:...` | Bare selectors are now normalized as CSS. Use `text:Submit` for text matching. |

## 0.3.x to 0.4.0 Migration

| Removed 0.3.x tool | 0.4.0 replacement | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `element_input_text` | `element_type` | Same input fields: `selector`, `text`, optional `timeout`, `clear`. |
| `wait_sleep` | `wait_time` | Same input field: `seconds`. |

Removed alias calls now return `TOOL_NOT_FOUND` instead of being silently
redirected. Update MCP client prompts, saved workflows, and docs to use the
replacement names.

## Browser Requirements

DrissionPage MCP starts a local Chrome/Chromium browser through DrissionPage. Install one of the following before using browser-backed tools:

- Google Chrome
- Chromium
- A compatible Chromium-based browser supported by DrissionPage

If the browser is installed in a custom location, configure the browser path through your environment or DrissionPage configuration. See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for diagnostics.

## Testing Matrix

The repository CI checks are intended to cover:

- Python package import and tool registration checks.
- Unit tests that do not require a live browser.
- MCP protocol tests that exercise stdio/list/call behavior without external network access.
- Package build validation.
- Browser integration tests on Chromium/Chrome against deterministic local fixtures and the shared `DrissionPage-test-site` SSR fixture when `DP_TEST_SITE_URL` is configured; the tests skip with explicit diagnostics if the browser cannot launch.

## Deprecation Policy

For public tool contract changes:

1. Document the upcoming change in the release notes.
2. Add or update tests that describe the old and new behavior.
3. Remove deprecated behavior only in a documented breaking release.
